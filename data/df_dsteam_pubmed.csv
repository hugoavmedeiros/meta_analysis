However, the low percentage of course completion by learners is a significant challenge for these platforms. Previous studies on this challenge have investigated user behavior and concerned topics in discussion forums, but these data are mostly momentary and cannot be used for long-term improvement. Thus, this study aimed to address this gap by analyzing learners' comments to identify the factors affecting user satisfaction and prioritize them to improve MOOC platforms. The purpose was to analyze the feedback and actual experiences of users shared through their comments on MOOC online platforms to explore factors affecting user satisfaction to optimize MOOC platforms. To achieve this, sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques were applied to the user feedback on courses with popular topics, such as Skills for Data Science Teams and Data-Driven Decision Making, available on Coursera.com. The study used DEMATEL analysis, which uses a relation matrix of factors to rank them based on their interrelationships, and network analysis to prioritize the factors that should be improved to achieve the highest user satisfaction. The effect of the proposed approach was investigated through a case study on a course from Coursera. The findings demonstrate that the suggested method has the potential to assist MOOC platforms in several ways. Firstly, it enables the identification of course strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, it allows for the identification of factors that influence learner satisfaction by analyzing user feedback.

The workforce included reorganized groups of physicians, nurses, outbreak investigators from several DPH programs, and a 100+ member data science team tasked with designing and operating a data system and information flow process that became the backbone infrastructure of support for field investigation and outbreak management in real-time. The accelerated workforce expansion was completed in 3 months. To prepare new and reassigned permanent staff for fieldwork, DPH and several faculty from the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health adopted a flexible, skills-based series of medical Grand Rounds. These 16 sessions were grounded in practice- and problem-based learning principles using case studies, interactive scenarios, and didactic presentations based on scientific and public health practice information to teach knowledge and skills that were needed to manage COVID-19 outbreaks in different sectors.

The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence-and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers’ artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models.

Whether an individual has traveled outside their respective country or never left their community, COVID-19 is a highly contagious illness, which can result in high death rates. Biobanks will play a role in providing tools to examine data from those receiving treatment along with reviewing the current and long treatment outcomes associated with this novel coronavirus disease. A diverse, global network made up of laboratory scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, data science teams, physicians, and so on must have a standardized, collaborative, virtual biobanking solution to share clinical expertise and evidence-based solutions. This virtual biobank must be centrally managed to ensure standardized quality assurance and quality control efforts. Virtual biobanks will eliminate the need to transport samples between two locations for a specific study, minimizing the risk of contamination. It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Standardized, collected information will be essential in the area of discovery and validation of disease markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies. It is essential for biobanks to collect COVID-19 specimens along with corresponding clinical and demographic data from COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Because COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness, proper collection procedures must be in place to collect respiratory samples for biobanking purposes.

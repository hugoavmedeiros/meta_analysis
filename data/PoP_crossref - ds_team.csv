We propose a DEA formulation for evaluation of cricket players in different capabilities using multiple outputs. This evaluation determines efficient and inefficient cricket players and ranks them on the basis of DEA scores. The ranking can be used to choose the required number of players for a cricket team in each cricketing capability. A real dataset, Indian Premier League 4 (IPL 2011), cricket players having various capabilities is used to choose the best cricket team. The proposed method has the advantage of considering multiple factors related to the performance of players in multiple capabilities collected from IPL 4 and aggregates their scores using a linear programming DEA model. This DEA Aggregation gives the scores of players objectively instead of using subjective computations. The proposed DEA method can be used to form a national cricket team from several clubs or a team of top cricketers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17461391.2012.705333",""

The rapid transition was brought about by the emergence of powerful new ML methods, allowing ML to successfully tackle many problems where numerical models and statistical models have been hampered. Deep convolutional neural network models greatly advanced the use of ML on 2D or 3D data. Transfer learning has allowed ML to progress in climate science, where data records are generally short for ML. ML and physics are also merging in new areas, for example: (a) using ML for general circulation model parametrization, (b) adding physics constraints in ML models, and (c) using ML in data assimilation.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2634460222000024",""

The study brought together the theoretical and practical contributions of IS and CS techniques capable of addressing the main informational challenges of educational environments reported in the literature. The preliminary results obtained consist of connections between concepts and techniques from the two knowledge areas that propose solutions for informational needs in education. Data mining, fuzzy logic, natural computing, text mining, data warehouse, ontologies, semantic web, and information retrieval were the most evident contributions identified when analyzing the demands of students, teachers, and managers. The conclusion reached is that articulating interdisciplinary knowledge of CS and IS in proposing data-driven approaches in the educational context is possible and necessary. These contributions proved capable of dealing with the challenge of supporting education in different ways by enabling even more robust theoretical and methodological solutions.","",""

The New Exploration Tools for European Pegmatite Green-Tech Resources (GREENPEG) spectral database contains the spectral signature, obtained through reflectance spectroscopy studies, of European pegmatites and minerals as well as their host rocks. Samples include pegmatites of the Nb–Y–F (NYF) and Li–Cs–Ta (LCT) chemical types and host rocks from pegmatite locations in Austria, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, and Spain. The database contains the reflectance spectra (raw and continuum-removed spectra), sample photographs, and main absorption features automatically extracted by a self-proposed Python routine. Whenever possible, spectral mineralogy was interpreted based on the continuum-removed spectra. A detailed description of the database, its content and structure, the measuring instrument, and interoperability with geographic information system (GIS) tools is available in this database report. Moreover, examples of how the data can be used and interpreted are also provided. The advantages and added value of the presented dataset reside in its European scale, with representative samples from pegmatites with distinct genesis, mineralogy, structure, and host rocks that can be used as a reference for pegmatite exploration at a global scale via, for example, satellite image processing. The reported spectral mineral assemblages can also be of interest when considering resource estimation or ore processing. Thus, it is expected that this open dataset, available on the Zenodo platform https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6518318 (Cardoso-Fernandes et al., 2022b), will be a reference for distinct types of users, ranging from academia to industry.","https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/3111/2023/essd-15-3111-2023.pdf",""

However, recent work in engineering, design and psychology contradicts this assumption. This study aims to examine the behavior of teams engaged in data science competitions. Crowdsourced competitions have seen increased use for software development and data science, and platforms often encourage teamwork between participants. Design/methodology/approach: We specifically examine the teams participating in data science competitions hosted by Kaggle. We analyze the data provided by Kaggle to compare the effect of team size and interaction frequency on team performance. We also contextualize these results through a semantic analysis. Findings: This work demonstrates that groups of individuals working independently may outperform interacting teams on average, but that small, interacting teams are more likely to win competitions. The semantic analysis revealed differences in forum participation, verb usage and pronoun usage when comparing top- and bottom-performing teams. Research limitations/implications: These results reveal a perplexing tension that must be explored further: true teams may experience better performance with higher cohesion, but nominal teams may perform even better on average with essentially no cohesion. Limitations of this research include not factoring in team member experience level and reliance on extant data. Originality/value: These results are potentially of use to designers of crowdsourced data science competitions as well as managers and contributors to distributed software development projects.","https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/TPM-03-2019-0024/full/html",""

On monthly intervals, the price of many commodities produced predominantly in tropical regions covary with the dominant mode of climate variability in this region, namely the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, for the spot prices returns of vegetable oils produced in Asia, we develop autoregressive (AR) models with exogenous ENSO indices, where for the first time these indices are generated by a purpose-built state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM) climate forecasting system. The GCM is a numerical simulation which couples together the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice, with the initial conditions tailored to maximize the climate forecast skill at multiyear timescales in the tropics. To serve as additional benchmarks, we also test commodity forecasts using: (a) no ENSO information as a lower bound; (b) perfect future ENSO knowledge as a reference upper bound; and (c) an econometric AR model of ENSO. All models adopting ENSO factors outperform those that do not, indicating the value here of incorporating climate knowledge into investment decision-making. Commodity forecasts adopting perfect ENSO factors have statistically significant skill out to 2 years. When adopting the GCM-ENSO factors, there is predictive power of the commodity beyond 1 year in the best case, which consistently outperforms commodity forecasts adopting an AR econometric model of ENSO.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2634460222000061",""

We implemented a pre-doctoral team-based training model with didactic and experiential curricular interventions to support the development of CTS research skills in a cross-disciplinary team environment. We assessed the potential impact of this new training model as a team science intervention that can catalyze new cross-disciplinary collaborations across the institution. Methods:: Between 2016 and 2020, 32 pre-doctoral students and 26 co-mentors participated in the assessment of the CTS Team program over a two-year period of TL1 training grant support. Data collection and analyses followed a program logic model and used a variety of metrics for clinical and translational scientist career success. Results:: CTS training in the context of CTS Teams supported improved self-efficacy for clinical research skills and resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of participation in cross-disciplinary collaborative activities by both trainees and mentors. Most CTS Team co-mentor pairs had not previously collaborated. Two-thirds of the co-mentors plan to continue collaborating, and most (85%) currently use or plan to use collaboration tools, for example, written collaboration plans, authorship agreements. Conclusions:: The CTS Team training model provides a unique clinical and translational science team training experience that embeds authentic cross-disciplinary research collaboration into PhD research projects. It establishes trainee cohorts that are diverse in terms of scientific disciplines and translational research phases, and creates a new cross-disciplinary community of practice across faculty members and research groups in multiple colleges.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2059866121008542",""

A resolutely transnational feminist approach on the other hand, can provide data theorists and practitioners with the hermeneutic tools necessary to identify and disrupt instances of injustice in a more inclusive and comprehensive manner.

Dynamical downscaling requires running expensive numerical models at high resolution, which can be prohibitive due to long model runtimes. On the other hand, statistical downscaling techniques present an alternative approach for learning links between the large- and local-scale climate in a more efficient way. A large number of deep neural network-based approaches for statistical downscaling have been proposed in recent years, mostly based on convolutional architectures developed for computer vision and super-resolution tasks. This paper presents deep learning for empirical downscaling (DL4DS), a python library that implements a wide variety of state-of-the-art and novel algorithms for downscaling gridded Earth Science data with deep neural networks. DL4DS has been designed with the goal of providing a general framework for training convolutional neural networks with configurable architectures and learning strategies to facilitate the conduction of comparative and ablation studies in a robust way. We showcase the capabilities of DL4DS on air quality Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) data over the western Mediterranean area. The DL4DS library can be found in this repository:","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2634460222000267",""

A main challenge of big data projects originates from the amount of people involved and that need to collaborate, the need for a higher and specific education, the defined approach to solve the analytical problem that is undefined in many cases, the data-set itself (structured or unstructured) and the required hard- and software (such as analysis-software or self-learning algorithms). Today there is neither an organizational framework nor overarching guidelines for the creation of a high-performance analytics team and its organizational integration available. This paper builds upon (a) the organizational design of a team for a big data project, (b) the relevant roles and competencies (such as programming or communication skills) of the members of the team and (c) the form in which they are connected and managed.","http://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/ejser/5/3/article-p132.xml",""

However, a few major aspects can be identified hampering a fast transition: (1) The classical “Open Science by Publication” (OSP) is not sufficient any longer since it serves different functions, leads to non-acceptable delays and is associated with high curation costs. Changing data lab practices towards OSD requires more fundamental changes than OSP. 2) The classical publication-oriented models for metrics, mainly informed by citations, will not work anymore since the roles of contributors are more difficult to assess and will often change, i.e., other ways for assigning incentives and recognition need to be found. (3) The huge investments in developing DS skills and capacities by some global companies and strong countries is leading to imbalances and fears by different stakeholders hampering the acceptance of Open Science (OS). (4) Finally, OSD will depend on the availability of a global infrastructure fostering an integrated and interoperable data domain—“one data-domain” as George Strawn calls it—which is still not visible due to differences about the technological key pillars. OS therefore is a need for DS, but it will take much more time to implement it than we may have expected.","https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dint_a_00082",""

We set out to define a new field of inquiry to move collective interests forward. Objectives and ApproachOur objectives were: 1. To create a concise definition of the emerging field of Population Data Science; 2. To highlight the characteristics and challenges of Population Data Science; 3. To differentiate Population Data Science from existing fields of data science and informatics; and 4. To discuss the implications and future opportunities for Population Data Science. Objectives 1 and 2 were met largely through International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN) member engagement, Objective 3 was evaluated via literature review, and Objective 4 was achieved through iterative and collective work on a peer-reviewed position paper. ResultsWe define Population Data Science succinctly as the science of data about people. It is related to, but distinct from, the fields of data science and informatics. A broader definition includes four characteristics of: i) data use for positive impact on individuals and populations; ii) bringing together and analyzing data from multiple sources; iii) identifying population-level insights; and iv) developing safe, privacy-sensitive and ethical infrastructure to support research. One implication of these characteristics is that few individuals or organisations possess all of the requisite knowledge and skills comprising Population Data Science, so this is by nature a multi-disciplinary “team science” field. There is a need to advance various aspects of science, such as data linkage technology, various forms of analytics, and methods of public engagement. Conclusion/ImplicationsThese implications are the beginnings of a research agenda for Population Data Science, which if approached as a collective field, will catalyze significant advances in our understanding of society, health, and human behavior and increase the impact of our research.","https://ijpds.org/article/download/918/835",""

Second, remote sensing data for segmented crowns was aligned with ground measurements by choosing the set of pairings which minimized error in position and in crown area as predicted by stem height.

We have generalized this finding by concluding that traditional social science based on independent concepts about individuals and interpretations of reality requires too many fixes to address its replication crisis, yet ignores the generalization of individuals to teams, for which social science has become largely irrelevant. Unable to process the data dependencies of autonomous human-machine teammates in orthogonal roles for successful teams, producing zero correlations, this problem extends to traditional social science predicated on the belief that perceptions in closed systems (laboratories) are eality. But, as the National Academy of Sciences has noted, this assumption fails in open spaces. Thus, the study of group processes has de-evolved to become overly focused on individuals (e.g., biases), which do not generalize to teams. For a theory of autonomous human-machine teams and systems, generalization is critical. By using an open-systems approach, we have been able to explain the failures of social science, and its ack of success in the field, and we have generalized to autonomous human-machine teams and human-human teams. We extend our theory to conclude that traditional belief logics uses assumptions that, if not tested in reality (e.g., with debates), can be lethal (e.g, DoD's drone tragedy in Afghanistan in 2021).

Neste contexto, desenvolver instrumentos voltados para extrair informações a partir do Big Data, fomentando o conhecimento no Processo de Tomada de Decisão, desperta a atenção das organizações. Na evolução dados ? informação ? conhecimento, requer-se a sinergia de competências de especialistas ao fomentar uma nova área de atuação, a Ciência de Dados. Como atribuições da área estão: obter dados originados de fontes heterogêneas e distribuídas na web; formalizar o tratamento dos dados e metadados; e arquitetar a exploração dos dados e metadados para produzir informação relevante no Processo de Tomada de Decisão. Considerando essas assertivas, o objetivo deste artigo é evidenciar a diferença e a complementariedade dos conceitos Big Data e Ciência de Dados. Como resultado, pontua-se que o Big Data é um termo intrínseco à infraestrutura do hardware e de serviços computacionais em nuvem necessários para o armazenamento, processamento e a distribuição de recursos. Em relação à Ciência de Dados, este é conexo à camada dos softwares para transformação dados em informação, subsidiando os tomadores de decisão em suas Tarefas Intensivas em Conhecimento.","https://revistas.marilia.unesp.br/index.php/bjis/article/download/8315/5641",""

The competition was divided into three tasks: 1) segmentation of tree crowns; 2) data alignment; and 3) tree species classification. In this paper the methods and results of team FEM in the NEON NIST data science evaluation challenge are presented. The individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation (Task 1 of the challenge) was done using a region growing method applied to a near-infrared band of the hyperspectral images. The optimization of the parameters of the segmentation algorithm was done in a supervised way on the basis of the Jaccard score using the training set provided by the organizers. The alignment (Task 2) between the segmented ITCs and the ground measured trees was done using an Euclidean distance among the position, the height, and the crown radius of the ITCs and the ground trees. The classification (Task 3) was performed using a Support Vector Machine classifier applied to a selection of the hyperspectral bands. The selection of the bands was done using a Sequential Forward Floating Selection method and the Jeffries Matusita distance. The results in the three tasks were very promising: team FEM ranked first in Task 1 and 2, and second in Task 3. The segmentation results showed that the proposed approach segmented both small and large crowns. The alignment was correctly done for all the test samples. The classification results were good, even if the accuracy was biased towards the most represented species.","https://peerj.com/preprints/26973v1.pdf",""

Libera&amp;#8217;s &amp;#160;attributes enable a seamless extension of the ERB climate data record. Libera will acquire integrated radiance over the CERES FM6-heritage broad spectral bands in the shortwave (0.3 to 5 &amp;#956;m), longwave (5 to 50 &amp;#956;m) and total (0.3 to beyond 100 &amp;#956;m) and adds a split-shortwave band (0.7 to 5 &amp;#956;m) to provide deeper insight into shortwave energy deposition. Libera leverages advanced detector technologies using vertically aligned black-carbon nanotubes with closed-loop electrical substitution radiometry to achieve radiometric uncertainty of approximately 0.2%. Libera will also employ a wide field-of-view camera to provide scene context and explore pathways for separating future ERB missions from complex imagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Libera science objectives associated with continuity and extension of the ERB data record are to identify and quantify processes responsible for ERB variability on various time scales. Beyond data continuity, Libera&amp;#8217;s new and enhanced observational capabilities will advance our understanding of spatiotemporal variations of radiative energy flow in the visible and and near-infrared spectral regions. They will also enable the rapid development of angular distribution models to facilitate near-IR and visible radiance-to-irradiance conversion.&lt;/p&gt;","",""

We further discuss the significance and opportunities of big data in the domain of social science research with a scrutiny of the challenges previously faced while using smaller datasets.

Associated also with Data Science is how direct and indirect outcomes and consequences of Data Science include decision support and policy making, and both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes. For such reasons, the importance is noted of how Data Science builds collaboratively on other domains, potentially with innovative methodologies and practice.

Based on the reflection on the Theory of Concentric Spheres (TCS), this article sought to reflect in the light on Information Science aspects related to paradigms and terminological issues that permeate the theme of data privacy. The research is exploratory and descriptive. During the investigation, we sought to know the different terminological currents that deal with privacy to relate to the theory above, verifying whether or not there is a relationship in its application with the paradigms of Information Science. It is concluded that part of the doctrine understands that the concept of privacy is generalized. Another part diverges, stating that they are different concepts. When comparing TCS with the paradigms of IS, analogous applications between both treated concepts are concluded.","",""

However, fewer opportunities exist for librarians to develop the more advanced skills and expertise necessary to support data science and open science. To better understand how to develop a library workforce prepared to develop services in the emerging areas of data science and open science, the National Library of Medicine convened a workshop of 15 librarians and information professionals with a range of expertise in data and open science. This session will present the workshop's recommendations and use participatory facilitation methods to engage attendees in conversation about how to prepare information professionals to meet the evolving challenges of data science and open science.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fpra2.82",""

Most notably, data related to publications or produced during programmes funded on public money (such as H2020 / Horizon Europe, and national programmes) now need to be made accessible according to FAIR principles. Beyond easy availability of published articles, the principle of open access to the data, may result in an increase in spending that would mainly benefit private editors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, mature solutions to this problem exist in the academic world, which are not only economical and rewarding, but also accessible to small research teams. These solutions also have applications to citizen science and pro-amateur projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Virtual Observatory&lt;/strong&gt;. VESPA (Virtual European Solar and Planetary Access) has focused for 10 years on adapting Virtual Observatory (VO) techniques to handle Planetary Science data [1] [2]. The objective of this activity is to build a contributory data distribution system both to access and publish data with minimum fuss. This system is responsive to the new paradigm of Open Science and FAIR access to the data, and is optimized to publish data with limited resources. VESPA therefore relies on an infrastructure maintained by the astronomical community, and enlarges it to support Planetary Science by publishing additional standards, increasing compliance with other fields (Earth observation, heliophysics, space physics&amp;#8230;), and adding new capacities to existing tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data description and access&lt;/strong&gt;. VESPA uses a standard access protocol called TAP, associated with a metadata vocabulary providing uniform description of datasets in the field (EPN-TAP). At the time of writing EPN-TAP is in the final stage of becoming a Recommendation of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) [3]. Many tools can search data services based on EPN-TAP, in particular the VESPA portal (http://vespa.obspm.fr), generic VO clients, and VO tools which also provide visualisation and processing functions (e.g. TOPCAT, Aladin, CASSIS for tabular data, images, and spectra). Specific access modes (via script, web services, Jupyter notebook, etc) are also available for advance usage. The VESPA portal is intended as a discovery tool that queries all EPN-TAP services together. It provides a convenient way to search archives described with the EPN-TAP metadata vocabulary, to cross-search many databases, and to send selected data products to generic, high-level visualization and processing tools maintained by the astronomy community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical implementation&lt;/strong&gt; relies on 60+ published data services from 20+ institutes, offering a variety of situations. The recommended method consists in the installation of a data server supporting EPN-TAP, which is available in a Docker container and can easily be deployed anywhere. This only requires permanent web connection and URL for the server, and it takes advantage of a global infrastructure supported by the community (registry of services and VO tools). Generic tutorials are available for easy implementation &amp;#8211; in a typical situation, data ingestion only requires a CSV list of data products described by the EPN-TAP parameters, although existing databases can be used to build a data service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Service publication is granted by simply declaring it in a common registry. The data themselves can be located anywhere, either locally or on public storage facilities such as Zenodo or B2SHARE (where VESPA communities have been declared).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributory science&lt;/strong&gt;. VESPA already distributes archives from pro-amateur collaborations, in particular PVOL for planetary images, but also RadioJove for radio observations of Jupiter (NASA-supervised project). Such archives are very helpful to complement professional surveys by filling gaps at several time scales with observations from multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A number of collaborative projects are discussed in the frame of Europlanet 2024 RI (NA2 activity), including: the telescopic network (test server already installed); fireball networks (individually or with a common data distribution facility); observations of comets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public availability and easy, structured access to the data obviously have potential applications to teaching and outreach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to derived data and science results. &lt;/strong&gt;Although observatories and space agencies have open archives, they are usually limited to raw or calibrated products, and do not include science-ready data published in articles. ESA&amp;#8217;s Planetary Science Archive as an EPN-TAP interface, as well as several ground-based facilities. Existing repositories of derived data include the ESA Guest Storage Facility (hardly searchable currently) and VizieR catalogue of article tables relevant to Solar System studies (available as an EPN-TAP service).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support&lt;/strong&gt;. In the frame of the Europlanet 2024 RI programme at least, the VESPA team gladly provides support to users and potential data providers. This of course is intended to become a community infrastructure and to outlive the Europlanet programmes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Europlanet-2024 Research Infrastructure project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No 871149.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;[1]&amp;#160;Erard et al 2018,&lt;em&gt; Planet.

Crowdsourced competitions have seen increased used for software development and data science, and platforms often encourage teamwork between participants.Design/methodology/approach – We specifically examine teams participating in data science competitions hosted by Kaggle. We analyze data provided by Kaggle to compare the effect of team size and interaction frequency on team performance. We also contextualize these results through a semantic analysis.Findings – This work demonstrates that groups of individuals working independently may outperform interacting teams on average, but that small, interacting teams are more likely to win competitions. The semantic analysis revealed differences in forum participation, verb usage, and pronoun usage when comparing top- and bottom-performing teams.Research limitations/implications- These results reveal a perplexing tension that must be explored further: true teams may experience better performance with higher cohesion, but nominal teams may perform even better on average with essentially no cohesion. A limitation of this research includes not factoring in team member experience level and reliance on extant data.Originality/Value – These results are potentially of use to designers of crowdsourced data science competitions as well as managers and contributors to distributed software development projects.</p>","",""

Our understanding of how the collaborative efforts spent by teams relate to their performance is still a matter of debate. Teamwork results in a highly interconnected ecosystem of potentially overlapping components where tasks are performed in interaction with team members and across other teams. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph neural network model to predict a team’s performance while identifying the drivers determining such outcome. In particular, the model is based on three architectural channels: topological, centrality, and contextual, which capture different factors potentially shaping teams’ success. We endow the model with two attention mechanisms to boost model performance and allow interpretability. A first mechanism allows pinpointing key members inside the team. A second mechanism allows us to quantify the contributions of the three driver effects in determining the outcome performance. We test model performance on various domains, outperforming most classical and neural baselines. Moreover, we include synthetic datasets designed to validate how the model disentangles the intended properties on which our model vastly outperforms baselines.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00442-1.pdf",""

The Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE, austral summer 2016/2017) surveyed a large number of variables describing the state of the ocean and the atmosphere, the freshwater cycle, atmospheric chemistry, and ocean biogeochemistry and microbiology. This circumpolar cruise included visits to 12 remote islands, the marginal ice zone, and the Antarctic coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we use 111 of the observed variables to study the latitudinal gradients, seasonality, shorter-term variations, geographic setting of environmental processes, and interactions between them over the duration of 90 days. To reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the dataset and make the relations between variables interpretable we applied an unsupervised machine learning method, the sparse principal component analysis (sPCA), which describes environmental processes through 14 latent variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results provide a proof of concept that sPCA with uncertainty analysis is able to identify temporal patterns from diurnal to seasonal cycles, as well as geographical gradients and &amp;#8220;hotspots&amp;#8221; of interaction between environmental compartments. Our analysis provides novel insights into the Southern Ocean water cycle, atmospheric trace gases, and microbial communities. More specifically, we&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;identify the important role of the oceanic circulations, frontal zones, and islands in shaping the nutrient availability that controls biological community composition and productivity;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;find that sea ice controls sea water salinity, dampens the wave field, and is associated with increased phytoplankton growth and net community productivity possibly due to iron fertilisation and reduced light limitation;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;elucidate the clear regional patterns of aerosol characteristics, stressing the role of the sea state, atmospheric chemical processing, and source processes near hotspots for the availability of cloud condensation nuclei and hence cloud formation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A set of key variables and their combinations, such as the difference between the air and sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, sea surface height, geostrophic currents, upper-ocean layer light intensity, surface wind speed and relative humidity played an important role in our analysis, highlighting the necessity for Earth system models to represent them adequately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study highlights the use of sPCA to identify key ocean&amp;#8211;atmosphere interactions across physical, chemical, and biological processes and their associated spatio-temporal scales.

To compete in the competition, I created a pipeline to perform three remote sensing tasks. First, a NDVI- and height-thresholded watershed segmentation was performed to identify individual tree crowns using LIDAR height measurements. Second, remote sensing data for segmented crowns was aligned with ground measurements by choosing the set of pairings which minimized error in position and in crown area as predicted by stem height. Third, species classification was performed by reducing the dataset's dimensionality through PCA and then constructing a set of maximum likelihood classifiers to estimate species likelihoods for each tree. Of the three algorithms, the classification routine exhibited the strongest relative performance, with the segmentation algorithm performing the least well.","https://peerj.com/preprints/26977.pdf",""

In this paper, we investigate the trends of match outcome predictability, assuming that the public is more interested in an event if there is some uncertainty about who will win. We reproduce previous methodology focused on soccer and we expand it by analyzing more than 300,000 matches in the 1996-2023 period from nine disciplines, to identify which disciplines are getting more/less predictable over time. We investigate the home advantage effect, since it can affect outcome predictability and it has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Going beyond previous work, we estimate which sport management model – between the egalitarian one popular in North America and the rich-get-richer used in Europe – leads to more uncertain outcomes. Our results show that there is no generalized trend in predictability across sport disciplines, that home advantage has been decreasing independently from the pandemic, and that sports managed with the egalitarian North American approach tend to be less predictable. We base our result on a predictive model that ranks team by analyzing the directed network of who-beats-whom, where the most central teams in the network are expected to be the best performing ones. Our results are robust to the measure we use for the prediction.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00448-3.pdf",""

Even though the popularity of these models has perhaps peaked with statisticians, they are still perceived and considered as the “state of the art” in many applied fields. However, while the asymptotic theory supporting the use of max-stable processes is mathematically rigorous and comprehensive, we think that it has also been overused, if not misused, in environmental applications, to the detriment of more purposeful and meticulously validated models. In this article, we review the main limitations of max-stable process models, and strongly argue against their systematic use in environmental studies. Alternative solutions based on more flexible frameworks using the exceedances of variables above appropriately chosen high thresholds are discussed, and an outlook on future research is given. We consider the opportunities offered by hybridizing machine learning with extreme-value statistics, highlighting seven key recommendations moving forward.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2634460224000542",""

This chapter covers a wide range of topics, including the future of data visualization and new data visualization technologies. Finally, I have come to the conclusion of our study on data visualization. In the eleven chapters preceding this one, I have reviewed some of the most important theoretical and practical components of visualization methods and applications, and their applications. As I have seen, developing an efficient and effective approach to building a data visualization application is challenging. This procedure represents the relevant data.","https://www.cambridge.org/engage/api-gateway/coe/assets/orp/resource/item/6266b5c41033887b5ff9f3cb/original/data-visualization-in-data-science.pdf",""

Recently, we linked electronic health record data with state agency data to form a regional Substance Misuse Data Commons (SMDC) using privacy-preserving record linkage. Our goal in this study was to use human factors design principles to design a data dashboard for OFR teams using the linked datasets that will overcome current barriers within OFR workflows. MethodsWe utilized NASA task load surveys, semi-structured interviews, and design sessions with end users to identify data needs for an optimal dashboard design. We assessed current workloads, data collection processes, and desired future state. We subsequently performed iterative design sessions for the generation and evaluation of low-fidelity prototypes. To overcome issues with privacy and security, we used synthetic data in a cloud-based platform to represent the SMDC for simulation.  ResultsEleven OFR organizers participated. Pre-dashboard surveys on existing workflow showed high mental workload associated with data aggregation and case review, identifying a need for more accessible, comprehensive data. In our low-fidelity dashboard demo with synthetic data, iterative design adjustments were made in data visualization, storyline organizations, and theme-based data aggregation across pre-hospital and hospital data. ConclusionsWe refined the data dashboard prototype into a high-fidelity version, set for further usability and human factors evaluation. We addressed privacy and security concerns through synthetic data use while the real-world data is maintained in a HIPAA-secure Azure cloud environment with access for approved users.","https://ijpds.org/article/download/2692/5611",""

The competition was divided into three tasks: 1) segmentation of tree crowns; 2) data alignment; and 3) tree species classification. In this paper the methods and results of team FEM in the NEON NIST data science evaluation challenge are presented. The individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation (Task 1 of the challenge) was done using a region growing method applied to a near-infrared band of the hyperspectral images. The optimization of the parameters of the segmentation algorithm was done in a supervised way on the basis of the Jaccard score using the training set provided by the organizers. The alignment (Task 2) between the segmented ITCs and the ground measured trees was done using an Euclidean distance among the position, the height, and the crown radius of the ITCs and the ground trees. The classification (Task 3) was performed using a Support Vector Machine classifier applied to a selection of the hyperspectral bands. The selection of the bands was done using a Sequential Forward Floating Selection method and the Jeffries Matusita distance. The results in the three tasks were very promising: team FEM ranked first in Task 1 and 2, and second in Task 3. The segmentation results showed that the proposed approach segmented both small and large crowns. The alignment was correctly done for all the test samples. The classification results were good, even if the accuracy was biased towards the most represented species.","https://peerj.com/preprints/26973.pdf",""

Traditionally, selectors rely on their experience and knowledge to evaluate a player's physical fitness, batting, and bowling performance. However, with the advancements in machine learning algorithms, it is possible to automate and improve the selection process. In this research, a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach is proposed for cricket player selection. This approach uses a combination of physical fitness data, batting and bowling statistics, and other relevant metrics to create a comprehensive player profile. Then three ML algorithms-linear regression, support vector regression, and random forests-are employed to identify the most promising players. Data is collected on a large number of cricket players and their performance in national and franchise leagues from the two most prominent cricket websites, espncricinfo, and cricbuzz, to evaluate the proposed approach. Then the proposed approach trained and tested the ML models on this data and compared their accuracy and performance. Based on the performance scores obtained from these models, two squads are selected for the national team and one squad for each franchise league team. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the selection process and identify players with high potential. Furthermore, results found that the support vector regression algorithm outperformed other ML models in terms of prediction and player selection.","https://ojs.wiserpub.com/index.php/CCDS/article/download/3741/1781",""

The literature identifies proper project definition as crucial for a project’s success, and also recognizes that the translation of business objectives into data-analytic problems is a difficult task. Unfortunately, common project structures, such as CRISP-DM, provide little guidance for this crucial stage when compared to subsequent project stages such as data preparation and modeling. Contribution: This paper contributes structure to the project-definition stage of data-analytic projects by proposing the Data-Analytic Problem Structure (DAPS). The diagrammatic technique facilitates the collaborative development of a consistent and precise definition of a data-analytic problem, and the articulation of how it contributes to the organization’s goals. In addition, the technique helps to identify important assumptions, and to break down large ambitions in manageable subprojects. Methods: The semi-formal specification technique took other models for problem structuring — common in fields such as operations research and business analytics — as a point of departure. The proposed technique was applied in 47 real data-analytic projects and refined based on the results, following a design-science approach.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40537-024-00916-7.pdf",""

Large numbers and data from multiple countries in a European study are required to investigate safety issue of TSOACs in subgroups, e.g. people with an intracranial haemorrhage. Objectives and ApproachWe developed an approach to rapidly replicate data and analyses to support cross-country distributed research within the UK/EU using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This project was conceptualised and initialled by linking relevant datasets held in multiple data warehouses, in Scotland with the Scottish National Data Safe Haven, and in Wales through the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. Analysts in Edinburgh and Swansea had remote access to each other’s datasets and worked collaboratively to harmonise variables and analysis scripts. . A common R code script has been produced to harmonise individual data as well as the outputs from the study. ResultsThe study screened data on 8M people to develop a cohort that included pseudonymised information of 4,153 individuals in Scotland and 2,676 individuals in Wales, 6,829 individuals in total. Standardised risk analyses were completed in both settings with ongoing work in combining the analyses. In Wales, 39.5% of the patients in the cohort had been admitted to hospitals due to serious vascular events or died caused by these events, after intracranial haemorrhage. Incident rates for male and female are 0.63 and 0.7 respectively. Within the cohort, 0.5% were prescribed with TSOACs and 3% with Warfarin (included as reference). The project is also in the process of including other European jurisdictions. Conclusion/ImplicationsThe adopted approach was the simplest, yet most efficient and cost-effective method to ensure consistency in analysis and coherence with currently available governance systems of both safe havens. It can also be considered as an initialisation of developing infrastructure to support research using EHRs across the UK and EU.","https://ijpds.org/article/download/784/700",""

A related term, “big data,” has been used to refer to one of the important challenges faced by data scientists in many applied environments: the need to analyze large data sources, in certain cases using high-speed, real-time data analysis techniques. Data science encompasses much more than big data, however, as a result of many advancements in cognate fields such as computer science and statistics. Data science has also benefited from the widespread availability of inexpensive computing hardware—a development that has enabled “cloud-based” services for the storage and analysis of large data sets. The techniques and tools of data science have broad applicability in the sciences. Within the field of psychology, data science offers new opportunities for data collection and data analysis that have begun to streamline and augment efforts to investigate the brain and behavior. The tools of data science also enable new areas of research, such as computational neuroscience. As an example of the impact of data science, psychologists frequently use predictive analysis as an investigative tool to probe the relationships between a set of independent variables and one or more dependent variables. While predictive analysis has traditionally been accomplished with techniques such as multiple regression, recent developments in the area of machine learning have put new predictive tools in the hands of psychologists. These machine learning tools relax distributional assumptions and facilitate exploration of non-linear relationships among variables. These tools also enable the analysis of large data sets by opening options for parallel processing. In this article, a range of relevant areas from data science is reviewed for applicability to key research problems in psychology including large-scale data collection, exploratory data analysis, confirmatory data analysis, and visualization. This bibliography covers data mining, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, Bayesian data analysis, visualization, crowdsourcing, web scraping, open source software, application programming interfaces, and research resources such as journals and textbooks.</p>","",""

It is not uncommon discussions on errors done during statistical analysis done on data by non-experts in statistics, in scientific papers. However, statistics is too important and crucial for science for being left to statisticians only. On this paper, we discuss the possibilities opened by openAI latest API called coder interpreter. This API is able to read CSV files, and perform statistical analysis on the dataset, having as starting point human's commands. Different from classical statistical tools, it is able to choose what method and library to use, get the results back, and give an evidence-based answer. The user need only to know what to ask, which may require minimal knowledge on statistical inference, most likely, covered on any course on statistical analysis. Several areas can benefit from this tool, we think, especially evidence-based medicine, an area where the researchers are also medical doctors. This tools is actually using open source python libraries: the python community was able to build a rich and powerful set of libraries for data science, and this new API from openAI is exploring those libraries. We believe that those tools can be used on real research, and we present a couple of examples, one of them, studying a dataset in diabetic patients. We hope to influence the usage of this tool by non-experts, as well experts, on statistics.","https://www.qeios.com/read/76QMHB/pdf",""

They both perpetuate and result in a dominance of male, white, hetero, and cis perspectives in how we make sense of and interact with the world. The most prominent data gap is the gender data gap notably described by Criado-Perez (2020). However, not only women, but all marginalized groups are affected by such gaps, as data about them are frequently not collected due to a disregard on behalf of those in power of the need to do so. LGBTIQ+ people, considered a ‘hidden population’ by demographers, are a case in point. The acronym is used to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and queer people, as well as all people with non-normative sexual or gender identities, including asexual and agender people, who do not consider themselves as falling under one of these labels. A first step towards identifying and closing data gaps is to take stock of data that already exist. In this paper we give an overview of LGBTIQ+ data in European social science archives. We researched all data archives of CESSDA ERIC, the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives, and found 66 LGBTIQ+ datasets in 9 of the 34 member and associated archives and 1 former member archive. We discuss characteristics, coverages, and findability of the identified datasets and approach the question of potential data gaps by analyzing the keywords assigned to each dataset by the archive.","https://account.datascience.codata.org/index.php/up-j-dsj/article/download/1693/1354",""

This study introduces a data-centric methodology for forming Software Engineering (SE) teams centred around personality traits. Our study analyzed data from an SE course where 157 students in 31 teams worked through four project phases and were evaluated based on deliverables and instructor feedback. Using the Five Factor Model (FFM) and a variety of statistical tests, we determined that teams with higher levels of extraversion and conscientiousness and lower neuroticism consistently performed better. We examined team member interactions and developed a predictive model using extreme gradient boosting. The model achieved a 74% accuracy rate in predicting inter-member satisfaction rankings. Through graphical explainability, it underscored incompatibilities among members, notably those with differing levels of extraversion. Based on our findings, we introduce a team formation algorithm using Simulated Annealing (SA), built upon the insights from our predictive model and additional heuristics.","",""

In this review paper, we explore the intersection of data science and quantum computing, focusing on the role of data analytics in advancing quantum computing applications. We begin with an overview of quantum computing fundamentals, including quantum mechanics principles and quantum algorithms. We then delve into topics such as quantum data representation, manipulation, and machine learning algorithms tailored for quantum computing environments. Additionally, we discuss quantum error correction and noise mitigation strategies essential for reliable quantum computation. Furthermore, we survey the landscape of quantum software development tools and frameworks, highlighting their importance in facilitating quantum algorithm design and optimization. Through case studies and examples, we demonstrate the practical applications of data science techniques in quantum computing, including quantum cryptography and quantum-enhanced data analysis. Finally, we identify future research directions and challenges in the field, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between the data science and quantum computing communities to unlock the full potential of quantum data science.","",""

It demonstrates that simply removing identifiers is not enough to avoid being able to re-identify someone. Privacy can be defined and enhanced by making the dataset k-anonymous, l-diverse or t-close, so as to combat homogeneity and linkage attacks against datasets that can reveal personal and/or sensitive information. This is illustrated with re-identification tales from datasets of movie viewing, search query, and location data. On the additional subject of making predictions, fairness is a major concern. The way in which the target variable is defined can already include bias in the dataset, as discussed in the context of pregnancy prediction and face recognition. Finally, it describes metrics and methods to define and remove such bias from the dataset, so as to avoid discrimination in the resulting predictive model.</p>","",""

Therefore, the intensity parameters of Poisson distributions, followed by the number of goals gained/lost by a team, can be regarded as the indices of the offensive/defensive performance of the team. Teams belonging to a professional football league have many games throughout the season. The performances of such teams should be considered not to be constant throughout the season. A Poisson regression model with varying coefficients is proposed to analyze and visualize the time-varying performance indices of football teams. It is also applicable to estimating the performances up to the middle of a season, and estimated performances can be used to predict the future game’s outcome probabilities. These methods are demonstrated with the data of the Japanese professional football league.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42081-022-00173-z.pdf",""

Like many STEM disciplines, some may be excluded from participating in EDS due to historical legacies, systemic barriers, and social prejudices that create unequal opportunities and access. To better understand barriers to participation, and to identify solutions and priorities, we conducted a survey of the participants of the first Environmental Data Science Summit. We identified three barriers to participation that matched with three solutions and priorities for the field. The most commonly identified barrier was an unsupportive work environment for minorities and a male-dominated culture; creating a supportive community and work environment, particularly for minorities, was identified as both a solution and a priority for broadening participation in EDS. The second most commonly identified barrier pertained to training and maintaining relevance— specifically, late or informal training experiences and time constraints limiting time to upskill. The solution and priority proposed included access to good mentors and teachers, open data and educational materials, and increased applicability of projects. Finally, the third most commonly identified barrier, solution, and priority relate to financial concerns and the funding landscape, with both the solution and priority identified as improving funding and salary conditions. The results of this study identify the key barrier to participation in EDS and highlight potential solutions to lower these barriers to build a more equitable future.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2634460224000098",""

Not only the impact of environmental factors, but also of conflict zones and disaster emergence for human mobility and migration can be investigated through analysing different types of remote sensing data by computational methods. In this chapter, after construing the essential concepts of remote sensing, sensors and satellite systems and highlighting the data content and access to publicly available remote sensing data products, we illustrate three application-specific show cases. These are on ethnic migration, environmentally induced human migration and armed conflict related forced migration from Uganda, Mexico, and Colombia, respectively. With this chapter, we documented that satellites are a high potential data source for deriving population estimations for at-risk-communities, displaced people, and refugee groups, for predicting forced migration flows, notably in the context of natural disasters, climate extremes and conflict zones; as well as for generating essential information to facilitate assistance and support for pre- and during-crisis/disaster resilience-building interventions. We conclude that further cooperation between scientists and practitioners is crucial to enhance the benefits and to address the challenges for developing human-rights compliant applications.</p>","",""

The large quantity of data processed during assimilation requires the computation to be distributed across increasingly many compute nodes; yet, existing approaches suffer from synchronization overhead in this setting. In this article, we exploit the formulation of data assimilation as a Bayesian inference problem and apply a message-passing algorithm to solve the spatial inference problem. Since message passing is inherently based on local computations, this approach lends itself to parallel and distributed computation. In combination with a GPU-accelerated implementation, we can scale the algorithm to very large grid sizes while retaining good accuracy and compute and memory requirements.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2634460224000475",""

Though the term data science is of recent origin, the field utilizes cornerstone computing and statistical concepts to solve data-specific challenges. The role of a data scientist is to extract maximum information from raw data. This role has spawned across disciplines but only acts as a supplemental measure to actual domain knowledge. The field of data science encompasses analytics, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling. Information security has not always been integral to the data science ecosystem. An increasingly connected world with heightened reliance on data has encouraged data scientists to be well-versed with data security.

Nevertheless, persistent challenges in RWD (e.g., messiness, voluminousness, heterogeneity, multimodality) and a growing awareness of the need for trustworthy and reliable RWE demand innovative, robust, and valid DS methods for analyzing RWD. In this article, I review some common current DS methods for extracting RWE and valuable insights from complex and diverse RWD. This article encompasses the entire RWE-generation pipeline, from study design with RWD to data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, methods for analyzing RWD, and trustworthiness and reliability guarantees, along with data ethics considerations and open-source tools. This review, tailored for an audience that may not be experts in DS, aspires to offer a systematic review of DS methods and assists readers in selecting suitable DS methods and enhancing the process of RWE generation for addressing their specific challenges.","https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-102423-113220?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf",""

The complexity and importance of statistics in scientific research necessitate a tool that empowers researchers from various backgrounds to conduct sound statistical analysis without being experts in the field. This paper introduces and evaluates the potential of OpenAI's latest API, known as the ""coder interpreter,"" to fulfill this need. Methods: The coder interpreter API is designed to comprehend human commands, process CSV data files, and perform statistical analyses by intelligently selecting appropriate methods and libraries. Unlike traditional statistical software, this API simplifies the analysis process by requiring minimal input from the user—often just a straightforward question or command. Our work involved testing the API with actual datasets to demonstrate its capabilities, focusing on ease of use for non-statisticians and investigating its potential to improve research output, particularly in evidence-based medicine. Results: The coder interpreter API effectively utilized open-source Python libraries, renowned for their extensive resources in data science, to accurately execute statistical analyses on provided datasets. Practical examples, including a study involving diabetic patients, showcased the API's proficiency in aiding non-expert researchers in interpreting and utilizing data for their research. Discussion: Integrating AI-based tools such as OpenAI's coder interpreter API into the research process can revolutionize how scientific data is analyzed. By reducing the barrier to conducting advanced statistics, it enables researchers—including those in fields where practitioners are often concurrently medical doctors, such as in evidence-based medicine—to focus on substantive research questions. This paper highlights the potential for these tools to be adopted broadly by both novices and experts alike, thereby improving the overall quality of statistical analysis in scientific research. We advocate for the wider implementation of this technology as a step towards democratizing access to sophisticated statistical inference and data analysis capabilities.","https://www.qeios.com/read/76QMHB.2/pdf",""

In many domains, like epidemiology or economics, time series data are collected to describe the observed phenomenon in particular locations over a predefined time slot and predict future behavior. Regression methods provide a simple mechanism for evaluating empirical functions over scattered data points. In particular, kernel-based regressions are suitable for cases in which the relationship between the data points and the function is not linear. In this work, we propose a kernel-based iterative regression model, which fuses data from several spatial locations for improving the forecasting accuracy of a given time series. In more detail, the proposed method approximates and extends a function based on two or more spatial input modalities coded by a series of multiscale kernels, which are averaged as a convex combination. The proposed spatio-temporal regression resembles ideas that are present in deep learning architectures, such as passing information between scales. Nevertheless, the construction is easy to implement, and it is also suitable for modeling data sets of limited size. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed model for solar energy prediction, forecasting epidemiology infections, and future number of fire events. The method is compared with well-known regression techniques and highlights the benefits of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and flexibility. The reliable outcome of the proposed model and its nonparametric nature yield a robust tool to be integrated as a forecasting component in wide range of decision support systems that analyze time series data.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ijds.2023.0019",""

Real-world evidence (RWE) generated from RWD empowers researchers, clinicians, and policymakers with a more comprehensive understanding of real-world patient outcomes. Nevertheless, persistent challenges in RWD (e.g., messiness, voluminousness, heterogeneity, multimodality) and a growing awareness of the need for trustworthy and reliable RWE demand innovative, robust, and valid DS methods for analyzing RWD. In this article, I review some common current DS methods for extracting RWE and valuable insights from complex and diverse RWD. This article encompasses the entire RWE-generation pipeline, from study design with RWD to data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, methods for analyzing RWD, and trustworthiness and reliability guarantees, along with data ethics considerations and open-source tools. This review, tailored for an audience that may not be experts in DS, aspires to offer a systematic review of DS methods and assists readers in selecting suitable DS methods and enhancing the process of RWE generation for addressing their specific challenges.","https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-102423-113220?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf",""

Extracting insights or actionable knowledge from city data and building a corresponding data-driven model is the key to making a city system automated and intelligent. Data science is typically the study and analysis of actual happenings with historical data using a variety of scientific methodology, machine learning techniques, processes, and systems. In this paper, we concentrate on and explore ``Smart City Data Science"", where city data collected from various sources like sensors and Internet-connected devices, is being mined for insights and hidden correlations to enhance decision-making processes and deliver better and more intelligent services to citizens. To achieve this goal, various machine learning analytical modeling can be employed to provide deeper knowledge about city data, which makes the computing process more actionable and intelligent in various real-world services of today's cities. Finally, we identify and highlight ten open research issues for future development and research in the context of data-driven smart cities. Overall, we aim to provide an insight into smart city data science conceptualization on a broad scale, which can be used as a reference guide for the researchers, professionals, as well as policy-makers of a country, particularly, from the technological point of view.","",""

Algorithms make choices efficiently using explicit or implicit concepts of precedence. Each prediction is optimized based on the importance of data, populations, comparisons, or values. Applying mathematical standards of consistency and perfection in human affairs can go awry. Because algorithmic optimization prioritizes specific populations and situations, unforeseen cases could spectacularly fail. An algorithm can overoptimize, meaning it focuses so much on one goal that it ignores other equally important goals not specifically articulated. Data science implemented over large systems at scale eventually must consider the secondary effects of optimized outcomes. Ethical data science is able to state the reasoning that drives choices and is aware of alternatives and trade-offs.

The Toronto Declaration was formulated in 2018 specifically to ensure that machine learning and AI could be held accountable for respecting, and promoting, universal human rights. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM, 2018) and the Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice of the American Statistical Association (ASA, 2022) describe the ethical practice standards for any person at any level of training or job title who utilizes computing (ACM) or statistical practices (ASA). These three reference documents can together define ""what is ethical AI"". All development, deployment, and use of computing is covered by the ACM Code; the ASA defines statistical practice to ""include activities such as: designing the collection of, summarizing, processing, analyzing, interpreting, or presenting, data; as well as model or algorithm development and deployment.” Just as the Toronto Declaration describes universal human rights protections, the ACM and ASA ethical practice standards apply to professionals, individuals with diverse background or jobs that include computing and statistical practices at any point, and employers, clients, organizations, and institutions that employ or utilize the outputs from computing and statistical practices worldwide. The ACM Code of Ethics has four Principles, including one specifically for Leaders with seven elements. The ASA Ethical Guidelines include eight principles and an Appendix; one Guideline Principle (G. Responsibilities of Leaders, Supervisors, and Mentors in Statistical Practice) with its five elements and the Appendix (Responsibilities of organizations/institutions) with its 12 elements are specifically intended to support workplace engagement with, and support of, ethical statistical practices, plus, the specific roles and responsibilities of those in leadership positions. These ethical practice standards can support both individual practitioners', and leaders', meeting their obligations for ethical AI worldwide.</p>","",""

As both data size and data dimensionality grow, finding efficient and effective ways to answer concrete questions, as well as discover unknown insights, from such data become increasingly important. We present an overview of recent information visualisation and visual analytics developments in this direction, with the aim of bridging the gap between Technical developments in this area and actual users and use-cases that can benefit from them. In this overview, we discuss strengths, limitations, assumptions, and other important characteristics of such visualisation methods, so as to help domain experts find optimal methods for their given application contexts.

This paper aims to examine the main points to demonstrate the challenges of analysing big data to research migrants and refugees and provide a guideline for young scholars how to deal with big data in studying migratory movements. This paper defends that refugees and migrants should be at the centre of the big data analysis.

Tais polinizadores contribuem na manutenção da reprodução de boa parte das angiospermas, assegurando a perpetuação dessas espécies. Os polinizadores bióticos também desempenham um importante papel na produção de alimentos, destacando-se as abelhas como responsáveis pelo aumento na produção de frutos de 70% das plantas cultivadas. Neste estudo apresentamos os dados das abelhas coletadas na APA Macaé de Cima, no município de Nova Friburgo, no estado do Rio de Janeiro. Apesar de a região Sudeste ser uma das áreas com grande esforço amostral e maior riqueza no país, os estados do Rio de Janeiro e Espírito Santo apresentam-se com lacunas de conhecimento. Para o estado do Rio de Janeiro a maior parte dos levantamentos são focados na tribo Euglossini. A APA constitui um interessante ambiente de investigação sobre polinizadores, em especial as abelhas, por se tratar de um relevante remanescente de Mata Atlântica no Estado. As coletas foram realizadas com periodicidade de 40 (± 5) dias durante os anos de 2018 e 2019. Foram utilizadas três metodologias de coleta de abelhas diferentes: pratos coloridos, iscas de cheiro e redes entomológicas. Foram coletados 1105 indivíduos distribuídos em 103 morfoespécies, das quais 60 foram identificadas em nível de espécie. As espécies estão distribuídas em 21 tribos e 56 gêneros, pertencentes às cinco famílias ocorrentes no Brasil. Este material fornece dados da abundância e riqueza de abelhas ao longo de dois anos, para uma região onde não há levantamentos anteriores para o grupo. Além disso, há registros de interações entre abelhas e plantas contribuindo para o conhecimento das interações entre plantas e abelhas.","https://ojs.datainscience.com.br/index.php/lads/article/download/48/40",""

These supply chains range from raw materials to end-product manufacturing. Hence, it is critical to accurately estimate the carbon footprint of these supply chains, identify GHG hotspots, explain the factors that create the hotspots, and carry out what-if analysis to reduce the carbon footprint of supply chains. Towards this, we propose an enterprise decarbonization accelerator framework with a modular structure that automates carbon footprint estimation, identification of hotspots, explainability, and what-if analysis to recommend measures to reduce the carbon footprint of supply chains. To illustrate the working of the framework, we apply it to the cradle-to-gate extent of the palm oil supply chain of a leading palm oil producer. The framework identified that the farming stage is the hotspot in the considered supply chain. As the next level of analysis, the framework identified the hotspots in the farming stage and provided explainability on factors that created hotspots. We discuss the what-if scenarios and the recommendations generated by the framework to reduce the carbon footprint of the hotspots and the resulting impact on palm oil tree yield.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S263446022400027X",""

By extracting essential data from the websites, a predictive data pattern can be produced to show the next day’s weather is with rain or not.  By applying different types of web mining and analyzing techniques those extracted weather-related data can be visualized to a typical pattern for weather forecasting with the main deciding factors of weather. With the use of these approaches, reasonably precise forecasts can be made up to about four to five days in advance. For the weather prediction analysis, we need to discover deciding factors of the next day’s weather. Particularly, common weather dependent factors and the relationship of the prediction to the particular phenomenon. The solution proposed by this research can be used to analyze a large amount of weather data which are in different forms in each source. By using predictive mining task our solution allows us to make predictions for future instances according to the model what we have created. Evaluation measurements for the selected data mining technique such as accuracy percentage, TP & FP Rate, Precision, F-Measure, ROC area, SSE, and loglikelihood for classification and clustering leads to create a high-quality model of prediction. Knowledge flow interface provides the data flow to show the processing and analyzing data with precise association rules. In order to evaluate the model, SSE values and time to build the model, are considered in an effective manner.","https://ijods.org/index.php/ds/article/download/3/2",""

The economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 creates a need to improve the social assistance system that has been implemented so far. The socialization process, data verification and other problems often create problems in determining the recipients of social assistance. To solve this problem, DSS can be one of the solutions in determining the recipients of social assistance. This study uses 3 criteria with 10 sub-criteria with 5 alternatives. This study uses the TDSP model which is the development of the CRISP-DM model. This study succeeded in performing manual calculations well. The weighting of the criteria is very important to give a good preference value. The grouping of sub-criteria helps decision makers to more easily provide comparisons between criteria. Alternative-1 is the best candidate in receiving social assistance with a score of 0.9519","https://ejournal.instiki.ac.id/index.php/sintechjournal/article/download/983/388",""

However, there are very few research activities that field in Indonesia that emphasize the principle of transparency of codes and data in the dissemination of the results. This issue is a major challenge for the Indonesian scientific community to verify the output of research activities from their peers. One common obstacle to the reproducibility of data-driven research is the portability issue of the computing environment used to reproduce the results. Therefore, in this article, we would like to offer a solution through Debian-based dockerized Jupyter Notebook that have been installed with several Python libraries that are often used in atmospheric science research. Through this containerized computing environment, we expect to overcome the portability and dependency constraints that often faced by atmospheric scientists and also to encourage the growth of research ecosystem in Indonesia through an open and replicable environment.","https://ijods.org/index.php/ds/article/download/18/19",""
